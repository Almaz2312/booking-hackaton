# booking-hackaton
This is a project that is made for booking a conference. It has simple functions to view which conference are there via ListView and DetailView. There is also a filter function added to conference, which filters by four parameters - conference_type, projector,
                conditioner, board in ListView. 
Additionally, it has a booking function. In there you can book a conference, by writing down your name, department, time from and time until you will be using a conference room.
Booking has three end points, one for ListView (you can also filter them by conference) to see all bookings, second one for detail, update and delete, last one for creating bookings.
